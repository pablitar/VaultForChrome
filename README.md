Vault for Chrome - Leap Motion Controller Integration for Chrome
=========================

A simple extension for using the Leap Motion Controller with Chrome.

The idea is to add little features to Chrome that take advantage of the Leap Motion Controller.

Obviously, this extension requires a Leap Motion Controller to function.

Current features:
* One Hand Scrolling: Put a hand over the Leap Motion Controller and 
extend four or more fingers (five is the most comfortable position). The
extension will then use the orientation of your hand to scroll horizontally
or vertically.
